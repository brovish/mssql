/* both GAM and SGAM use bit 1 for denoting free but how can we tell if a uniform extent has free page?:
current use of extent| GAM bit setting| SGAM bit setting

free, not in use		1				0

uniform extent			0				0
or full mixed extent

mixed extent with		0				1

--1rst interval. GAM page records which extents have been allocated for any type of use. 1 for extent that is free and 0 for in use.
--excluding the page header and other overhead, it has about 8000 bytes or 64000 bits for use or. that means it can store usage for 64000 extents 
--or for 512000 pages or about 4 gb of memory. So 1 GAM page bitmaps' extents totalling about 4 GB of memory. So when our database file is larger than
--4 GB, SQL server needs multiple GAM pages. First GAM page is always the 3rd page and the next is after 511230 pages(about 4 GB)

--dumping out GAM page which is always the 3 page from start(page id is 0 based, so we pass 2) and the display mode is 3 for database tpc_e

--A SGAM page again looks after 4 GB of memory. It records which extents are used as mixed extents and have atleast 1 unused page(how do we track 
--which uniform extents have free pages?). If bit is 1, that extent is a mixed extent and has free a page. If 0, the extent either is not a mixed 
--extent or is a mixed extent with no free pages. First SGAM page is always the 4rd page and the next is after 511230 pages(about 4 GB)
--sgam(1:3)
--dumping out SGAM page which is always the 4 page from start(page id is 0 based, so we pass 3) and the display mode is 3 for database tpc_e

--2nd interval. the second GAM and SGAM page occurs after 511230 pages from the first one.
