21 was an example?
from Sree to everyone:    9:05 AM
does that number signyfy anything
from Ben Miller to everyone:    9:25 AM
yes
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:25 AM
yes she did
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:25 AM
the DMV, yes
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:31 AM
hah
from Sree to everyone:    9:33 AM
is this at any given instance if so could it be an outlier in the workload.. should we care when you rerun
from Sree to everyone:    9:34 AM
Can non-leaf pages be fragmented as well .. if so which kind of fragmentation affects it .. only the page density kind?
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    9:50 AM
can you using fill factor eliminate page splits and should you be able to reduce page splits to 0?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:55 AM
whoa
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:55 AM
no wonder these are forward commit only
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    9:56 AM
My next question when the page splits happen and you have all the page splits freeing up space on the page, is that space used for future inserts.
from Sree to everyone:    9:59 AM
anyidea any of the perf tools go about differentiating the kinds of pagespits?
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:01 AM
I guess if once the system does page splits just like auto tuning could it determine that this system could use a different fill factor on the indexes and then automatically do it.

from rajeshd to everyone:    10:21 AM
I was under impression 80% is a best practice but after todays class, it depends on the data correct? if the inserted row lives for ever, we could set fill factor 0%?
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:22 AM
the key is to coordinate the maintenance schedule with the actual fragmentation that the application can cause.  So that is hard if you don't know how to figure out your maintenance schedule.
from rajeshd to everyone:    10:28 AM
any problems concerns reported with using resumable index in 2019? for later

from Sree to everyone:    10:43 AM
also how to measure much of the nasty pagesplits is allowable, or should you always aim for zero ? I know it is relative and there cannot be an absolute measure but looking for heuristics to go about this if zero is too impractical
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    10:44 AM
What is your opinion on AdaptiveIndexDefrag solution from Tiger team?
from Randolph West to everyone:    10:45 AM
it does a lot of that IIRC
from Sree to everyone:    10:45 AM
so apart from monitoring transaction log.. there are wait stats to look that target pagesplits to measure \ quantify how much of a problem it is
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    10:45 AM
Didn't go to much details
from Sree to everyone:    10:46 AM
i have one more question is it okay to unmute?
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    10:48 AM
This might be helpful to understand GUID's and fragmentation (Index Maintenance #1 - GUIDs v.s. Fragmentation by Jef Moden): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx-FuNp4fOA - it also covers what Paul just said
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    10:49 AM
*Jeff Moden
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    10:51 AM
One of the many things I took away from that was also that common practice to REORGANIZE compresses the number of pages, and in a random key (such as a GUID) means you are likely to increase page splits. It's covers a lot of stuff.

when I have dreated composite nonclustered unique indexes I always get dead lock issues.  Is there a magic thing to do
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:55 AM
ok 
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:55 AM
that does
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:56 AM
we would delete a row and add a row with the same key value and I took the unique out
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:57 AM
in the same transaction
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:57 AM
but there was multithreading so another thread could be adding it in
from Sree to everyone:    12:00 PM
So if you have a Heap (c1,C2,C3,c4,c5) and say you have an NC - C1,C2,C3 Includes C4 and now if you add a CLustering index on C3,C4 what happens to your NC
from Sree to everyone:    12:00 PM
with or without include

is sp_sqlskills_helpindex proc available in the demo script ?

it's available from Kimberly's blog

even with 6 levels (!), the clustered index is still more efficient in my experience
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    12:39 PM
this is really interesting because so many heap believers dont understand this 
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    12:39 PM
were stupid they are the masters
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    12:40 PM
i hate this debate on the internet becuase is it almost religoius

from Randolph West to everyone:    1:04 PM
ugh
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:04 PM
dealing with that now
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:07 PM
I discovered the deployment layer here does a phyisical compare to get changes, so FG placement, compression, fill factor all are drivem by dev deploymnents.  Ouch.  Attempting remediation on that now...

auto update stats is okay to turn off though if you are managing your regular stats updates?
from rajeshd to everyone:    1:24 PM
just curious what's the motivation for turning auto update stats..though managing regular stats updates? 
from rajeshd to everyone:    1:25 PM
turning auto update stats off^
from sree to everyone:    1:28 PM
the undersampling that happens for large tables due to 2016 change that auto stats kick in more frequently now and so stats are severely undersampled sometimes leading to bad plans
