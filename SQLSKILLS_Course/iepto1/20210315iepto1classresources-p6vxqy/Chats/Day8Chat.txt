yeah we do that 
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    9:19 AM
Yesterday it did a scan -- today with the new index it did a seek anyways. I think?
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    9:19 AM
But that's why you had both
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    9:20 AM
Because yesterday it did the scan -- you wanted to foce the seek. Today you didn't need to force it

from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:27 AM
I am wondering if taking out mi would make that big of a difference and just put it in the inc
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:28 AM
ok
from Randolph West to everyone:    10:29 AM
darn, I have to jump into a meeting now
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:30 AM
I want to avoid creating a table with a different pk which seems what incl leads you to
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:30 AM
sure
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:34 AM
that is the art part
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    10:37 AM
sanity check... included columns are just in the leaf level of the NC index right?
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:37 AM
Yes
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    10:38 AM
perfect, have had a mental block on that for years :D
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:40 AM
how about the argument the mulitiple indexes can be access by different processes. so iti s good to have duplicate indexes.
from sree to everyone:    10:40 AM
answered my question too in my case the clustered index came in after the NC that had the clustering key as include as preexisting index
from Randolph West to everyone:    10:45 AM
I dig filtered indexes
from rajeshd to everyone:    10:46 AM
for such active and inactive data column, if there are are two different query patterns one would search with active and other with inactive, what's the best index , two filtered or one NC on state? 
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    10:52 AM
Filtered indexes sound similiar to partitioned tables to me. Could you explain why you would use one over the other?
from Randolph West to everyone:    10:54 AM
I like filtered indexes for excluding values that dominate a column
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    10:54 AM
Would you recommend to set optimal session settings on the instance level?
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:54 AM
She makes up phrases like 'interval subsumption' all the time...
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:55 AM
'Yes, it's the indexing fnerg-bloop problem'
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    10:55 AM
I never thought of that, using a filetered index instead of a partiioning
from sree to everyone:    10:56 AM
do we talk about filtered stats today?
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:00 AM
I think that would be a big challenge of using filtered index because the call has to be very specific for that filter.
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    11:01 AM
Thanks -- definitely helped clear it up
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    11:01 AM
that one-filtered-index limit, is that because a query basically only uses one NC index per table?
from Kimberly Slides to everyone:    11:02 AM
Brian - no, it's because the complexity would be too high AND because of interval subsumption
from Kimberly Slides to everyone:    11:02 AM
(I'll talk more about that though)
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    11:02 AM
ah ok, i thought it just had a hard limit of sorts.. gotcha



from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    11:35 AM
We learnt that the hard way. The target queries got faster with the filtered index but inserts from an SP started to fail; and yes, the error message which advises "INSERT failed because the SET options have incorrect settings:" is comma separated!
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    11:36 AM
After digging into it, it became apparent that the 'incompatible' session settings may have been a development practice. At the time, I didn't think to look whether the vendor was actually using the settings, for example: WHERE [column] = NULL
from Randolph West to everyone:    11:36 AM
yes you mentioned this previously
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    11:39 AM
So many levels for it to go 'wrong' :(
from Randolph West to everyone:    11:40 AM
Stephen, yikes
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    11:40 AM
just to keep it "interesting" , SSMS ANSI settings defaults are different from those of SQLCMD.....
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:42 AM
it is a real world problem
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    11:42 AM
however, SQLCMD mode in SSMS inherits apparently the ANSI settings from SSMS 
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    11:49 AM
If you can then you should is my motto
from Randolph West to everyone:    11:52 AM
I would pivot the attributes, because wide tables are unwieldy

from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    12:33 PM
There's some ANSI settings for the SProcin there too
from sree to everyone:    12:44 PM
but what's the reason for not allowing it as a config switch
from rajeshd to everyone:    12:45 PM
Sorry for asking now..if a procedure is created with recompile, you mentioned the proc plan will not be stored in the procedure cache, so for every execution of the proc it requires new plan generation correct? and is that not same as using with Recompile hint?
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    12:45 PM
users will always do what you allow them to do. even when the users are developers.
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    12:48 PM
So I have two or three queires in the database and they use a differnt predicate one uses only one set of keys so wuldn't a duplicate help

What are Pros and Cons of placing index on multi-file FileGroup?
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    12:56 PM
It is induce parallelism on creation & maintenance

so WITH RECOMPILE is like executing a proc in incognito mode
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    1:29 PM
oh agreed, i don't spend all day in incognito
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    1:30 PM
like query store

ugh
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:32 PM
yeah.  i've written them. last life though
from rajeshd to everyone:    1:32 PM
I remember sp_recompile would INVALIDATE plan from the cache, can we be able to get the invalidated plan details? what's the lifetime of that invalidated plan? question for later.
from John C to everyone:    1:33 PM
yeo seen those
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:34 PM
Redgate has it

nice cliffhanger
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    1:46 PM
will you be covering how temp tables use stats later in the course. 
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    1:46 PM
ok no problem
from Ricky Davis to everyone:    1:47 PM
Oh I found Paul Whits in my bookmarks for the temp table index usage
