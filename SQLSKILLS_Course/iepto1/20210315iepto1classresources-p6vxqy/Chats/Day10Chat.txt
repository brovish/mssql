Oh.  But it's so much better than the client making a call/query for each individual category_no choice!
from James Donnelly to everyone:    9:38 AM
I've used INTERSECT to do 1st pass on multiple unrelated AND conditions on billion record tables as well, only returning relevant keys than doing other SELECT column lookups once filtered.. back to subsecond or second performance

these links would be shared along with the demo scripts? thank you
from rajeshd to everyone:    9:55 AM
locking and index internals both zips downloads the same index internal zip. not sure why!
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:55 AM
Kimberly, do you mind adding in your duplicate index finder? The links to the script seem to be broken.
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:56 AM
Sorry ??
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:56 AM
hire me, I'll fix it :P
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:56 AM
I'll try that
from James Donnelly to everyone:    9:59 AM

I've solved some cool problems with indexed views
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:08 PM
columnstore does LOB data in 2017 now
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:08 PM
yep
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:18 PM
when I did the Joe Obbish-inspired trillion-row table using columnstore, select performance wasn't great but it was only ~1.5GB in size.
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:22 PM
yup, it took several minutes to run a SELECT...WHERE
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    12:24 PM
What about Indexed Views on Columnstore table?
from Christina Fetherolf to everyone:    12:33 PM
I need to know how to use Google. That's it.

Classic CE
from rajeshd to everyone:    12:59 PM
Is there a way to find approximate estimated time it would take for a statistic full scan on a VLT ? just wondering, other than try with 0/5/10/ incremental so on
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    12:59 PM
wish it were true
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:59 PM
And I thought it would have been on the various JOINS....
from rajeshd to everyone:    1:01 PM
thanks
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    1:01 PM
It is not linear, 50% takes almost same time as 100%
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    1:13 PM
classic Pareto's rule problem
from Brian Kallion to everyone:    1:19 PM
almost makes me wonder if a standard deviation in the histogram would be useful someho
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:37 PM
that is cool
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    1:37 PM
THAT is cool
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:37 PM
hehe
from Oleg.Pokrovskiy to everyone:    1:39 PM
Perhaps, we need to address this problem to large tables (100s of mln rows) with number of histogram steps ~ 200 and highly skewed data in the index. The area of interest is a top of the distribution, as they causing the CE problem.
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:40 PM
*shudder*
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:44 PM
Ola handles those, right?
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:44 PM

from sree to everyone:    2:15 PM
So if doing a full scan stats fixes your performance issue .. What percentage of time do you see this as being a parameter sensitivity problem and not an undersampled stats problem? 
from sree to everyone:    2:15 PM
In my case i am seeing the undersampled stats in the plan that performs worse and the new sampling rate getting used in the better plan so can i rule out parameter sensitivity in that case or no?
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:18 PM
Hypothetical... the query I mentioned the other day which ran for *hours* was because the vendor DW is populated with minus one's (-1) where data is missing (so they can inner join everything). For whatever reason, for about two months, when UPDATE STATISTICS sampled the data it didn't pickup the lowest value (i.e. -1). That seemed odd to me, but could it have been 'true' sampling?
from rajeshd to everyone:    2:19 PM
for paramter sensitive procedures: proc works best 99% and goes bad for 1 and fixed with sp_recompile. is option(Recompile) or ( KEEPFIXED PLAN )? what's best way
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    2:20 PM
if you have captured both plans, see if the cached parameter(s) used are different and how....
from rajeshd to everyone:    2:22 PM
sure..Bruce. 
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:23 PM
The histogram should have a first step of -1, but it started much higher (which I think was the next value)
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:23 PM
Yeah, I FULLSCAN'ed every evening when I knew they were going to run it
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:23 PM
It did then
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:24 PM
Removed the nested loops (tens of thousands)
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:24 PM
Follow on question to make sure I've understood, if I had created a filtered statistic for the minus one value, without a RECOMPILE the query wouldn't use it?
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:24 PM
Darn, They FORCE ORDER because they knew best, but they don't recompile most of their reloads. Thanks.
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:25 PM
It wasn't a 'bad
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:25 PM
'bad' fix... it actually would have eliminated all the rows earlier and been worse; but I didn't like it either.
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:25 PM
Looks like they've found something that works so it's spreading; I'll keep on top of them.
from rajeshd to everyone:    2:27 PM
I would have to request for budget to attend PTO2
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    2:28 PM
it'll be well spent, rahesh.
from Stephen Skidmore to everyone:    2:28 PM
(without FORCE ORDER I think I determined that the optimiser would have elimated the table sooner in the execution plan because it 'knew' the tens of thousands rows of -1 records weren't there, ahem)
from rajeshd to everyone:    2:28 PM
I love this training
