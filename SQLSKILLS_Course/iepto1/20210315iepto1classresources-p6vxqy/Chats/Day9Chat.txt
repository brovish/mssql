We were relying on SentryOne for Plans but for some procedure with 20-40 blocks of code, it doesn't. So we started capturing plans before recompiling of such procs for analysis afterwards bad vs good plan.

if a auto created statistics last_updated time is very recent, can that be understand as that statistics was used by query optimizer for producing an optimal plan ?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:35 AM
SQL Server query optimizer will sometimes have statistics created where none exists.  but it won't update any.

They probably share the same undying system table that is hidden by the views we use.

we have been seeing some blockings on secondary readable replica, because of a statistics process. We have update statistics asyn on, auto update statistics on. Any clue as to what could be the problem?

from Ben Miller to everyone:    1:57 PM
is the AG async or synchronous?

auto update stats will update manually-created stats correct?  hope so

yes+ is always better
