ehhh, I was going to say 4
from sree to everyone:    9:18 AM
is there a heuristic to determine what is considered a large memory grant ? sorry if i missed it
from sree to everyone:    9:18 AM
is it a percent 
from sree to everyone:    9:18 AM
of total memory
from sree to everyone:    9:26 AM
yes
from sree to everyone:    9:40 AM
is it 2019 feature?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:24 AM
oh cool
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:28 AM
if they are running defauls, it timed out.
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:28 AM
what one customer the "white screen bug"
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:28 AM
yes.  dev *never* asks the dba until it breaks....
from Ben Miller to everyone:    10:29 AM
I deal with it a lot in PowerShell and SMO.
from Ben Miller to everyone:    10:29 AM
A LOT

from sree to everyone:    11:50 AM
could this happen on a heap?
from sree to everyone:    12:12 PM
 In a deadlock involving exchange events.. how is the amount of log needed to determine deadlock victim determined.. is it the log used per thread that is taken into account? 
from sree to everyone:    12:13 PM
ok might have an outlier example will email you
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:13 PM
we saw this parallelism deadlocks.  turns out the table had a number of indexes and trriggers.  tweaking the fill factor and clustering key resolved it,
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:15 PM
certainly a case by case kind of thing.  and we got lucky is my opinion.
from sree to everyone:    12:19 PM
Do you have recommendations to identify which TRY Catch blocks need to retry for deadlocks... are you saying ALL or are there patterns to look for
from sree to everyone:    12:30 PM
SOS Scheduler yield at 61 doesn't bode well
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:35 PM
when were stats last updated?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:36 PM
is Query Store configured?
from James Donnelly to everyone:    12:36 PM
ok, I was just about to suggest sys.dm_io_virtual_stats lol, but if it's not disk subsystem...
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:38 PM
resource governor?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:40 PM
oh come on
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:40 PM
Profiler
from sree to everyone:    12:40 PM
trace
from sree to everyone:    12:40 PM
showplan events
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:40 PM
what extended events?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:41 PM
what is the last one?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:41 PM
this has a showplan I bet
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:41 PM
LOL
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:42 PM
I hate that I needed a hint to get this one
from James Donnelly to everyone:    12:42 PM
do we have a baseline trace taken in the good times?  (to compare against)
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:44 PM
the nine years between training took their toll on my memory apparently
from sree to everyone:    12:49 PM
Memory issues?
from sree to everyone:    12:51 PM
wait stats as well
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:51 PM
my first suspicion is MAXDOP, so I'd want to see that too
from sree to everyone:    12:51 PM
PLE seems too low
from sree to everyone:    12:52 PM
is that a symptom as well lol
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:52 PM
that was very single-user-mode
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:53 PM
I see MAXDOP is 0, and I'd like to know how many CPU cores there are, and how many NUMA nodes there are
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:54 PM
what is cost threshold?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:54 PM
I missed it
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:54 PM
1?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:54 PM
yeah....
from sree to everyone:    12:55 PM
100
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:55 PM
what are the log writes?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:56 PM
huh
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:58 PM
this is a tough exercise for me in this virtual environment.  the irl distractions here.....  
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:58 PM
are there any blocking queries?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:59 PM
just like a production issue with the brass breathing down my neck....
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:59 PM
thinking in terms of read committed versus, I dunno, serializeable?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:00 PM
I feel like this is RBAR stuff
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:01 PM
when were statistics last updated?
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    1:02 PM
Maybe check for spill data?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:02 PM
oh dear, he's typing
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:03 PM
dang
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:03 PM
are there any deadlocks?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:06 PM
tempdb usage?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:06 PM
waiting tasks
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:06 PM
and outstanding tasks
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:07 PM
so what is that task?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:08 PM
oh DAMN
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:09 PM
93MB? no
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:09 PM
it's too low
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:09 PM
I want to know the query text
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:11 PM
so we're out of memory
from sree to everyone:    1:11 PM
target server memory
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:11 PM
Mem to leave is also a way
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:12 PM
stolen memory
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    1:13 PM
512GB
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:13 PM
what is max server memory?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:13 PM
yikes
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:14 PM
boom
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:14 PM
LPIM
from sree to everyone:    1:15 PM
stats were fudged with?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:16 PM
I feel better that when I asked about stats I was on the right track
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:19 PM
there was a lot, yes
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:20 PM
has anyone solved these right away?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:21 PM
LOL
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:22 PM
memory thing, firstly
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:23 PM
yeah, that's what I see when there's not enough RAM for the workload (which itself has several causes)
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:24 PM
the writing is small
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:24 PM
is this tempdb contention?
from sree to everyone:    1:25 PM
hotspot contention
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:25 PM
I'm thinking out loud
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:25 PM
file 2
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:25 PM
is tempdb
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:26 PM
8088
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:27 PM
allocation
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:27 PM
I'm with Sree here, it's a hotspot
from sree to everyone:    1:27 PM
Log?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:27 PM
well let's look at the page
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:28 PM
that's a low number for an object_ID
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:29 PM
do it
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:31 PM
in memory
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:31 PM
clustered GUIDs for everyone!
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:32 PM
I'm sitting really close to the screen and I see PAGELATCH_EX now
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:32 PM
hahaha
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    1:33 PM
I can only imagine the nightmare of interviewing with you guys :)
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:33 PM
no
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:34 PM
you can use a derived table
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:34 PM
not
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:34 PM
that too
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:34 PM
look, the text is small
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:34 PM
thank you
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:34 PM
LOL
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:34 PM
text is very small, as is my laptop unfortunately
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    1:35 PM
@Jeff - Erin does DBA interviews for some of our clients. 
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:35 PM
that's a weird standard
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:35 PM
I had one where they switched to table variables because I got better perf out of one once
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:37 PM
only small sets right?
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:37 PM
i've seen that too
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    1:38 PM
When I was at Microsoft, my favorite interview question was to have them whiteboard pseudo-code to print the contents of an arbitrary X x Y size array of numbers, starting the centre, in clockwise spiral order.
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:40 PM
cargo cult programming
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:41 PM
I'd like to do the scenario if the other folks don't mind
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:43 PM
if something isn't going parallel, it's that function
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:44 PM
yep
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:44 PM
I'd inline that to start, because it's so simple
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:46 PM
MAXDOP, cost threshold
from sree to everyone:    1:46 PM
COP
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:47 PM
haha
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:47 PM
it's slow yeah
from sree to everyone:    1:47 PM
I\O statistics
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:47 PM
indexes
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:48 PM
so hard to read
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:48 PM
that's better thanks
from sree to everyone:    1:49 PM
any warnings in the plan
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:49 PM
I don't like the HAVING and WHERE conditions being like that
from sree to everyone:    1:49 PM
memory grant info in the execution plan
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:49 PM
the index suggestion is probably on to something
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    1:50 PM
that seemed way to obvious lol
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:50 PM
but I'd rewrite the query to move the > 2000 predicate to the WHERE clause if that's what they want
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:51 PM
oh ok, yes
from sree to everyone:    1:51 PM
windowing function?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:52 PM
repartitition streams
from sree to everyone:    1:52 PM
oh yeah you look at the threads
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:52 PM
ya
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:52 PM
it's skewed on threads
from sree to everyone:    1:52 PM
still 1
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:52 PM
interesting
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:52 PM
oh we saw this
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:52 PM
yes
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:52 PM
lol
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:53 PM
the plan is forced
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:53 PM
wrong term
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:53 PM
that thing
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:54 PM
I do seem to forget about Resource Governor all the time...
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:55 PM
please don't say power saving
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:55 PM
oh gosh I hate triggers
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:55 PM
ya not a fan
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:56 PM
TRIGGERS!!!!!  the best & most common punchline!  
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:57 PM
yeah
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    1:57 PM
SQL Triggers me
from James Donnelly to everyone:    1:58 PM
my plan is definitely to go through this module 3 times
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:59 PM
Jon doesn't remember me
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    1:59 PM
I take it personally every time
