Interesting.....
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:17 AM
Thanks you.  yup!
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:17 AM
it does to me!
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:18 AM
better and more accurate than the old school grep on module definitions.....
from Randolph West to everyone:    9:18 AM
yes definitely
from Jeff Farr to everyone:    9:19 AM
Very cool, is there also a way to track SSIS containers execution in a package using this same process?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:20 AM
oooh...  but if we have query stYore enabled, we have a better handle retention.  would that help?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:23 AM
Typical SQL answer coming.... well, it depends on ...  a) your configuration and b) your expertise and c) other factors....

Can we go back to the prior slide and discuss xe sessions that don't have a defined target and where that happens?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    9:32 AM
thanks.  again.

Guessing one of the use cases for XE sessions could be 's

'studying performance impact of turning on new features in sql server' ? Wondering if there is a reference i could lookup to see what events are related the feature or just a reference of all events in general?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:35 AM
So is the live data viewer sorta, kinda a different target for the xe session?  looks like xevents has something similar to trace in terms of a pipeline that some monitoring tools use, a reader pipeline of sorts.
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:35 AM
I wish...

And your query on targets system dmv tells me the answer is yes:  event_stream  :-)

There is a known non-yielding scheduler issue in all versions of SQL Server including SQL Server 2019 for the .NET SqlDependency class if the devs don't handle the queue activation notification task firing properly and clean up the SqlDependency by calling Dispose() before enlisting a new one.   even in 2019
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:20 PM
wow
from Jonathan Kehayias to everyone:    12:20 PM
It has to do with the fact that there is a system internal table that tracks the dependency and the execution plans show that they exist

Windows will respond to memory pressure by paging and then the thread stack would allocate

The scheduling change Paul talked about in 2016+ is called Large Deficit First (LDF) scheduling.  We will discuss it a little more in the SQLOS CPU module.

That is_user_process filter is incredibly important on any system using IMOLTP because there will be at least #CPU’s of system internal sessions on the server when that is enabled on any database

does cpu affinity affect max thread count?

Trying to understand the difference you talked about in the execution plan actual vs estimated in terms of parallel plan evaluation.. 
from sree to everyone:    1:21 PM
COP drives whether it is a Serial \ Parallel plan and then MAXDOP drives whether it is executed in parallel?
