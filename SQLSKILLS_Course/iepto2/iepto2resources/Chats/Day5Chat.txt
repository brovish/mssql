ooh, beat me to the question
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    9:27 AM
is there any significance to base-10 group size number, vs base-2 counts of CPU cores? Or is this just for example if your core count is a multiple of 10?
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    9:29 AM
got it, thanks
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    9:30 AM
excellent, you answered my question

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/sql-2016-it-just-runs-faster-multiple-log-writer-workers/ba-p/318732     The number of log writers created during the SQL Server instance startup depends on the number of hardware NUMA nodes present on the system.

that was me
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:06 AM
nope
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:07 AM
well that explains why it doesn't improve performance at least
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:09 AM
yep
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    10:22 AM
hahahahahahaha (sob) @ licensing

I'm reveling in the information dump
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:41 AM
Calibration, please!  How frequently does a CPU resource implication lead to this kind of dive into the guts?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:43 AM
Scale plays a part -- either in #transactions or resources, eg large cpu, memory,  ?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:44 AM
I have run into worker thread pressure, exhaustion and it's always been a bad query or 2....

reminds me when we moved from 32-bit to 64-bit, where performance could have tanked
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:46 AM
More cores = faster is such a fallacy
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:46 AM
And is common management-think
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:47 AM
Fred Brooks "Mythical Man Month" and N Wirth's proposition alive and well still.
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:47 AM
Indeed
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:48 AM
And Wirth -- best programs written by individuals.  but "useful" programs too big for 1 person.

how do multiple instances on same node play out here 
from sree to everyone:    12:08 PM
yes
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:11 PM
A/V -- yeah.  We did not have exclusions configured properly in Windows Defender.....
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:16 PM
I show the top ten waits, and then the top ten with CXPACKET filtered out
from Randolph West they/them to everyone:    12:26 PM
yes
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:08 PM
 my jaw just dropped.... 
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:09 PM

dang
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:22 PM
there is only the estimated plan... and it may be the parallel one
from sree to everyone:    1:28 PM
what is a good way to get an apples to apples comparison when changing\upgrading CPU
from James O'Doherty to everyone:    1:28 PM
do you kinow of any issues/gotchas running under Nutanix AHV virtualization
from sree to everyone:    1:28 PM
sorry if reduntant i did miss the first 45min

Distributed replay?
from James O'Doherty to everyone:    1:32 PM
yes thanks
from James O'Doherty to everyone:    1:32 PM
a customer is looking at this primarily because licensing is not per core migrating from VMWare 
from sree to everyone:    1:32 PM
what you mentioned about %privileged time vs %user time .. does that hold good for VMs as well?
from sree to everyone:    1:34 PM
any corelation between clockspeed\core count and the type of workload OLTP\DW .. any skew  work better for any kind of workload ?
