I had a boss one time that when called for an emergency, the first thing he’d do was go get a cup of coffee.

Deep breath...

One of our vendors insists that 20% fill factor on a few of their tables is by design... is there ever a case for a FF this low?
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:56 AM
Eric - that's ridiculously low
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:56 AM
I wonder if they have it backwards - thinking that FF 20 means leave 20% space
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    10:57 AM
Why?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    10:58 AM
How old is this app?  This have vestiges of antiquated issues..

from Bruce McManus to everyone:    11:31 AM
Haven't used it.

the best thing about XE is the (newish) SSMS XE Profiler
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    11:32 AM
MS support had us collect 2.3GB HADR related stuff.  Had to parse it.  Now I am a fan...  getting better at it.from James Donnelly to everyone:    11:32 AM
EE is cool, I liked Profiler and love EE, super useful for debugging/optimization.
from Danitza to everyone:    11:32 AM
have seen it but i'm so used to profiler

1). If the action is on the same thread, and you are looking at the execution timing, if those actions introduce a delay on the query TAT will that influence or affect the reported execution time?
from Randolph West to everyone:    11:54 AM
same
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    11:58 AM
For that 2.3GB, powershell module to the rescue..
from Randolph West to everyone:    12:11 PM
this is the cool stuff - filtering per event
from sree to everyone:    12:26 PM
could you repeat how to got to this aggegration view lost trak of it
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:26 PM
Actually you can only filter at the event level from my experience...
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    12:41 PM
Jeff asks: Does predicate syntax  support XAND and XOR?  Just curious.
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    12:42 PM
Sounds like some people don't have 'Everyone' in the chat menu - don't know why - chat to me privately and I'll pass on the question.
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    12:43 PM
I'll show you an awesome use of causality tracking on Wednesday
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:43 PM
That’s a real teaser!  Cool!
from SQLskills Training to everyone:    12:43 PM
I have - unless you have a debugger attached, you need to reboot SQL Server
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    12:45 PM
I’ve never seen a supported Xop in the GUI or the sys tables.from SQLskills Training to everyone:    12:46 PM
Yuip - I checked - not there
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:02 PM
hanging in there
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:02 PM
it helps that you presented this at my user group
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:03 PM
Yeah.   This is much better than my other exposure and experience
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:03 PM
15 min of what?  More XE?  Yes!from sree to everyone:    1:03 PM

from James Donnelly (privately):    1:03 PM
I'm ready for more
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:04 PM

from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:08 PM
Quicken ui....  I think their first windows product introduced that 
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:15 PM
I used this recently to figure out the test environment wasn't actually running against the correct database — because the data NEVER populated after 30 seconds
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:17 PM
were the bracketed values the variable values or session IDs?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:23 PM
There has been an addition to some XE for queryhash_unsigned.  Yay!
from Randolph West to everyone:    1:23 PM
yep
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:24 PM
different page.
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:24 PM
think it may not have been the variables
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:24 PM
was a while back
from sree to everyone:    1:24 PM
i think it is just the number of times it ran
from Eric Reid to everyone:    1:24 PM
similar not that page
from sree to everyone:    1:26 PM
you mentioned how server side traces and XE sessions are close as far as their overhead is considered.. how do i go about measuring the overhead for either .. trying to make the determination if a session\trace is okay to be left running?
from Bruce Pratt to everyone:    1:26 PM
We need an XEsession tsql definition beautifier....
